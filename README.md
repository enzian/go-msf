# go-msf, a framework for microservice architectures

go-msf is a framework of tools and libraries that support you in building your microservice architecture. It takes most of the "plumbing" work of your shoulders and helps you run your microservices as quickly as possible. It helps you update services without any downtime and helps you host and scale your API-servers-

Building `go-msf`requires you to have [GO v1.5 or higher](https://golang.org/dl/) installed. Additionally you'll need [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) to get the vendored dependencies.

If you're new to `go-msf`, we recommend you read the [Getting Started Guide](docs/GettingStarted.md). If you're already familiar with `go-msf` you might be more interested in one of the following:

* Service-Directory specs (docs pending)
* API-Server specs (docs pending)
